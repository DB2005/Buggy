In the MVP phase, the objective was to understand the fundamentals of mechanical design, including CAD modeling, basic material strength analysis, and general engineering design principles. The project also served as a practical study of vehicle construction, focusing on the interaction between structural elements and mechanical subsystems.

During this phase, several key engineering challenges were identified:

An overly primitive overall structure, requiring further refinement and optimization.

A metal frame lacking proper triangulation and efficient load distribution.

Incomplete development of the wheel suspension and steering control systems.

Lack of standardization in parts, fasteners, and bearing selection.

Undefined material selection and insufficient justification for material choices.

The long-term objective of the project is to develop a fully functional buggy design that is simple to manufacture, structurally efficient, and capable of withstanding operational loads through proper stress distribution and material selection.
